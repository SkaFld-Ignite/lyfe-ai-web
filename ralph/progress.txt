# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Lyfe AI Marketing Website Redesign
# Branch: ralph/website-redesign
# Started: 2026-01-31

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `"use client"` directive for all React context files
- Context pattern: createContext → useX hook with null check → XProvider component
- Marketing layout wraps children, contexts should wrap the entire layout structure
- TypeScript types should be exported alongside the context for reuse
- For scroll-based animations: use Framer Motion's `useScroll()` + `useTransform()` instead of manual scroll listeners
- Brand colors: emerald-500/600/700 for primary CTAs and accents (healthcare-appropriate)

## US-001: Update metadata and remove starter template references
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Changes:**
- Updated app/(marketing)/page.tsx metadata: title, description, keywords, OG tags
- Updated app/(marketing)/layout.tsx metadata
- Removed all "Cult Pro Polar Starter" references
- Added healthcare-focused keywords
**Verified:** Typecheck passes

## 2026-01-31 - US-002
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created AudienceContext in lib/context/audience-context.tsx
- Implemented AudienceProvider with 'provider' | 'patient' state
- Added URL hash sync (#providers / #patients)
- Added hashchange listener for browser back/forward navigation
- Implemented hydration mismatch prevention with isInitialized state
- Wrapped marketing layout with AudienceProvider

**Files changed:**
- lib/context/audience-context.tsx (new)
- app/(marketing)/layout.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Context providers using browser APIs (window.location) need hydration protection
- Use isInitialized state pattern to prevent SSR/client mismatch
- URL hash changes can be listened to with 'hashchange' event
- Sidebar component in components/ui/sidebar.tsx is a good reference for context patterns

## 2026-01-31 - US-003
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created AudienceToggle component in components/audience-toggle.tsx
- Tab-style toggle with 'For Providers' and 'For Patients' buttons
- Uses AudienceContext to read/set audience state
- Active tab has filled background (bg-background), inactive has muted text
- Smooth 150ms transition animation on state change
- Accessible with ARIA attributes (role="tablist", aria-selected)
- Focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation

**Files changed:**
- components/audience-toggle.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The existing tabs.tsx component uses data-[state=active] pattern from Radix; for custom toggles, use isActive prop with conditional classes
- Match tab styling to existing muted background/foreground color scheme for consistency
- Always include ARIA attributes for accessibility (role, aria-selected, aria-controls)
- Focus-visible styles with ring-2 ring-ring pattern matches existing design system

## 2026-01-31 - US-004
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created LyfeLogo component in components/lyfe-logo.tsx
- Emerald gradient logo mark with healthcare-themed SVG icon (lifeline/pulse design)
- Text branding: "Lyfe" in foreground + "AI" in emerald accent color
- Updated marketing-navbar.tsx with new branding and design
- Nav links: How It Works, For Providers, For Patients, About (using hash anchors for future sections)
- Login text link with muted styling pointing to /auth/login
- Request Access CTA button with emerald-600 background
- Sticky header with backdrop blur on scroll using Framer Motion useScroll/useTransform
- Updated mobile menu with LyfeLogo and new CTA buttons
- Changed desktop nav breakpoint from md to lg for better spacing

**Files changed:**
- components/lyfe-logo.tsx (new)
- app/(marketing)/marketing-navbar.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Framer Motion's useScroll() and useTransform() are great for scroll-based animations without listeners
- Fixed header needs z-50 to be above other content
- Backdrop blur requires bg-background/80 (semi-transparent) to work properly
- Use lg: breakpoint for nav when you have 4+ items to avoid cramping on tablets
- Emerald-500/600/700 is a good healthcare-appropriate color scheme

## 2026-01-31 - US-005
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Redesigned marketing-footer.tsx with Lyfe AI branding
- Updated brand section: Lyfe AI name, tagline, Nashville TN location
- Used LyfeLogo component for consistent branding
- Quick links: Home, How It Works, For Providers, For Patients, About
- Legal links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, HIPAA Notice
- Contact section with email link (hello@lyfe.ai) using Mail icon
- Dynamic copyright year using new Date().getFullYear()
- Updated hover colors to emerald-500 for brand consistency
- Improved responsive grid: sm:col-span-2 lg:col-span-1 for brand section

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-footer.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Reuse LyfeLogo component across all branding touchpoints (header, footer)
- Footer sections use uppercase tracking-wider headers for visual hierarchy
- Use motion.a for subtle hover animations on interactive elements (scale: 1.02)
- HIPAA Notice is important legal link for healthcare-focused products

## 2026-01-31 - US-006
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created ProviderHero component in app/(marketing)/hero-provider.tsx

- Staggered entrance animations using Framer Motion (baseDelay + staggerDelay pattern)
- Mobile-aware animations using useIsMobile hook

**Files changed:**

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- GlowEffect accepts custom colors array for brand-specific gradients
- Use emerald palette for healthcare: ["#10b981", "#059669", "#047857", "#34d399", "#10b981"]
- Stagger pattern: baseDelay + (staggerDelay * index) for clean sequential animations
- isMobile check allows faster/simpler animations on mobile for performance
- Hero buttons follow: primary (filled emerald) + secondary (bg-secondary with border)
