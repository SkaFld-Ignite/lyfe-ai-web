# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Lyfe AI Marketing Website Redesign
# Branch: ralph/website-redesign
# Started: 2026-01-31

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `"use client"` directive for all React context files
- Context pattern: createContext → useX hook with null check → XProvider component
- Marketing layout wraps children, contexts should wrap the entire layout structure
- TypeScript types should be exported alongside the context for reuse
- For scroll-based animations: use Framer Motion's `useScroll()` + `useTransform()` instead of manual scroll listeners
- Brand colors: emerald-500/600/700 for primary CTAs and accents (healthcare-appropriate)
- For content switching with animations: use AnimatePresence with mode="wait" and unique key props on motion.div
- SVG icons: Place in components/icons/[category]/ with barrel export (index.ts), accept className prop, use aria-hidden="true"

## US-001: Update metadata and remove starter template references
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**Changes:**
- Updated app/(marketing)/page.tsx metadata: title, description, keywords, OG tags
- Updated app/(marketing)/layout.tsx metadata
- Removed all "Cult Pro Polar Starter" references
- Added healthcare-focused keywords
**Verified:** Typecheck passes

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-002
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created AudienceContext in lib/context/audience-context.tsx
- Implemented AudienceProvider with 'provider' | 'patient' state
- Added URL hash sync (#providers / #patients)
- Added hashchange listener for browser back/forward navigation
- Implemented hydration mismatch prevention with isInitialized state
- Wrapped marketing layout with AudienceProvider

**Files changed:**
- lib/context/audience-context.tsx (new)
- app/(marketing)/layout.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Context providers using browser APIs (window.location) need hydration protection
- Use isInitialized state pattern to prevent SSR/client mismatch
- URL hash changes can be listened to with 'hashchange' event
- Sidebar component in components/ui/sidebar.tsx is a good reference for context patterns

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-003
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created AudienceToggle component in components/audience-toggle.tsx
- Tab-style toggle with 'For Providers' and 'For Patients' buttons
- Uses AudienceContext to read/set audience state
- Active tab has filled background (bg-background), inactive has muted text
- Smooth 150ms transition animation on state change
- Accessible with ARIA attributes (role="tablist", aria-selected)
- Focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation

**Files changed:**
- components/audience-toggle.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The existing tabs.tsx component uses data-[state=active] pattern from Radix; for custom toggles, use isActive prop with conditional classes
- Match tab styling to existing muted background/foreground color scheme for consistency
- Always include ARIA attributes for accessibility (role, aria-selected, aria-controls)
- Focus-visible styles with ring-2 ring-ring pattern matches existing design system

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-004
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created LyfeLogo component in components/lyfe-logo.tsx
- Emerald gradient logo mark with healthcare-themed SVG icon (lifeline/pulse design)
- Text branding: "Lyfe" in foreground + "AI" in emerald accent color
- Updated marketing-navbar.tsx with new branding and design
- Nav links: How It Works, For Providers, For Patients, About (using hash anchors for future sections)
- Login text link with muted styling pointing to /auth/login
- Request Access CTA button with emerald-600 background
- Sticky header with backdrop blur on scroll using Framer Motion useScroll/useTransform
- Updated mobile menu with LyfeLogo and new CTA buttons
- Changed desktop nav breakpoint from md to lg for better spacing

**Files changed:**
- components/lyfe-logo.tsx (new)
- app/(marketing)/marketing-navbar.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Framer Motion's useScroll() and useTransform() are great for scroll-based animations without listeners
- Fixed header needs z-50 to be above other content
- Backdrop blur requires bg-background/80 (semi-transparent) to work properly
- Use lg: breakpoint for nav when you have 4+ items to avoid cramping on tablets
- Emerald-500/600/700 is a good healthcare-appropriate color scheme

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-005
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Redesigned marketing-footer.tsx with Lyfe AI branding
- Updated brand section: Lyfe AI name, tagline, Nashville TN location
- Used LyfeLogo component for consistent branding
- Quick links: Home, How It Works, For Providers, For Patients, About
- Legal links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, HIPAA Notice
- Contact section with email link (hello@lyfe.ai) using Mail icon
- Dynamic copyright year using new Date().getFullYear()
- Updated hover colors to emerald-500 for brand consistency
- Improved responsive grid: sm:col-span-2 lg:col-span-1 for brand section

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-footer.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Reuse LyfeLogo component across all branding touchpoints (header, footer)
- Footer sections use uppercase tracking-wider headers for visual hierarchy
- Use motion.a for subtle hover animations on interactive elements (scale: 1.02)
- HIPAA Notice is important legal link for healthcare-focused products

- Subheadline about AI aggregating medical records into timeline
- Primary CTA: "Request Access" button with emerald GlowEffect (rotating gradient)
- Secondary CTA: "Watch Demo" button with Play icon
- Staggered entrance animations using Framer Motion (baseDelay + staggerDelay pattern)
- Mobile-aware animations using useIsMobile hook
- Used Magnetic component for button hover effects

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/hero-provider.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- GlowEffect accepts custom colors array for brand-specific gradients
- Use emerald palette for healthcare: ["#10b981", "#059669", "#047857", "#34d399", "#10b981"]
- Stagger pattern: baseDelay + (staggerDelay * index) for clean sequential animations
- isMobile check allows faster/simpler animations on mobile for performance
- Hero buttons follow: primary (filled emerald) + secondary (bg-secondary with border)

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-007
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created PatientHero component in app/(marketing)/hero-patient.tsx
- Headline: "Your Health Records. Finally In One Place." (with emerald accent)
- Subheadline: "Access, understand, and share your complete medical history—free."
- Primary CTA: "Request Access" button with emerald GlowEffect (same as ProviderHero)
- Secondary CTA: "Learn How It Works" button with BookOpen icon
- Same staggered entrance animations as ProviderHero (baseDelay + staggerDelay pattern)
- Uses same components: Framer Motion, GlowEffect, Magnetic, useIsMobile hook

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/hero-patient.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Patient-focused messaging emphasizes simplicity: "free", "understand", "share"
- Provider vs Patient hero differentiation: Provider emphasizes EMR sync/clinical workflow, Patient emphasizes access and understanding
- Secondary CTA icons: Play for video demos (ProviderHero), BookOpen for learning/how-it-works (PatientHero)
- The GlowEffect colors array should be consistent across both heroes for brand cohesion

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-008
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Rewrote marketing-hero.tsx to use AudienceContext for audience-aware rendering
- Renders ProviderHero when audience is 'provider', PatientHero when 'patient'
- Added AudienceToggle component centered at top of hero section
- Implemented smooth crossfade animation (300ms) between hero variants using AnimatePresence
- Used AnimatePresence mode="wait" for clean exit/enter transitions
- Added min-height container to prevent layout shift during transitions
- Removed old "Vibe Marketing" content and HeroProductImage component

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-hero.tsx (rewritten)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- AnimatePresence with mode="wait" ensures exit animation completes before enter animation starts
- Use key prop on motion.div to trigger animation on content change (key="provider-hero" vs key="patient-hero")
- min-h-[400px] prevents layout shift when content height varies between hero variants
- Duration 0.3s (300ms) is ideal for crossfade transitions - fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to be smooth
- aria-labelledby on hero containers connects to ARIA controls in AudienceToggle for accessibility

## 2026-01-31 - US-009
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created 4 SVG icon components in components/icons/workflow/
- FragmentedRecordsIcon: Scattered documents with various tilts representing disorganized medical records
- AiAggregationIcon: Neural network visualization with central brain node and incoming data points
- TimelineIcon: Horizontal timeline with connected events and data cards
- EmrSyncIcon: Two database cylinders (Lyfe AI + EMR) with bidirectional arrows
- All icons use healthcare-appropriate color scheme (emerald-500, sky-500, emerald-600)

- components/icons/workflow/timeline-icon.tsx (new)
- components/icons/workflow/emr-sync-icon.tsx (new)
- components/icons/workflow/index.ts (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- SVG icons should use aria-hidden="true" since they're decorative
- Use linearGradient and radialGradient defs for richer icon visuals
- Healthcare color palette: emerald (primary), sky/cyan (secondary), teal (accent)
- Icon components should accept className for flexible sizing (default w-16 h-16)
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for easy importing: `import { X, Y } from "@/components/icons/workflow"`
- SVG transforms can create scattered/tilted effects for visual interest

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-010
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created WorkflowStep component in components/workflow-step.tsx
- Props interface: icon (ReactNode), title, description, stepNumber, isActive, className
- Step number badge positioned absolutely at top-center with -top-3 offset
- Icon container with rounded-full background, adaptive styling based on isActive
- Active state: emerald-50/500 highlights for border, background, and text
- Inactive state: standard card styling with border-border
- Hover effect: subtle scale transform (1.02) using Framer Motion spring animation
- Tap effect: scale down (0.98) for tactile feedback
- Max-width constraint on description (max-w-[200px]) for consistent card sizing

**Files changed:**
- components/workflow-step.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use motion.div with whileHover/whileTap for interactive card effects
- Spring animation with stiffness: 400, damping: 25 feels snappy but natural
- Absolute positioning with -top-3 and -translate-x-1/2 centers badge above card
- Conditional dark mode classes (dark:bg-emerald-950/20) for theme consistency
- Export both component and types for reuse: `export type { WorkflowStepProps }`

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-011
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created WorkflowConnector component in components/workflow-connector.tsx
- SVG-based animated connector line for linking workflow steps
- Props: isAnimating (boolean), direction ('forward' | 'backward'), className
- Horizontal layout on desktop (md:block), vertical on mobile (block md:hidden)
- Animated dash pattern using Framer Motion strokeDashoffset
- Pulsing arrow head animation for visual feedback when isAnimating=true
- Linear gradient background with emerald-500 color scheme
- Separate SVG viewBoxes for horizontal (100x20) and vertical (20x40) layouts

**Files changed:**
- components/workflow-connector.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use motion.line with strokeDasharray and animated strokeDashoffset for flowing dash effect
- Animation direction controlled by offset values: [0, -N] for forward, [-N, 0] for backward
- Separate SVGs for responsive layouts better than trying to rotate/transform a single SVG
- linearGradient with varying stopOpacity creates nice fade effect on connectors
- Arrow heads use polygon with animated opacity for pulsing effect
- repeat: Infinity on Framer Motion transitions for continuous animation

## 2026-01-31 - US-012
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Moved ProductWorkflow component from components/product-workflow.tsx to app/(marketing)/marketing-workflow.tsx
- Component already had full implementation from previous US-004 commit
- 4 workflow steps: Fragmented Records → AI Aggregation → Clinical Timeline → EMR Sync
- Scroll-triggered animations using Framer Motion's useInView hook
- Staggered entrance animations (staggerChildren: 0.2) for sequential step reveals
- Responsive layout: horizontal (grid-cols-4) on desktop lg+, vertical with timeline on smaller screens
- Sophisticated WorkflowStepCard with audience-aware content, highlight badges, click interactions
- Animated gradient connector lines built inline (more feature-rich than basic WorkflowConnector)

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-workflow.tsx (moved from components/)
- app/(marketing)/page.tsx (updated import path)
- components/product-workflow.tsx (deleted)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When acceptance criteria says "create in path X", existing implementations may already exist elsewhere - check and relocate if needed
- The existing ProductWorkflow was created as part of US-004 commit but placed in wrong location
- Inline card implementations can be more sophisticated than generic reusable components when they need context-specific features
- useInView from Framer Motion is preferred over manual Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Marketing section components should live in app/(marketing)/ rather than components/ for better organization

## 2026-01-31 - US-013
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Added audience-specific workflow step titles (providerTitle, patientTitle fields)
- Step 4 now shows "EMR Sync" for providers, "Share with Doctors" for patients
- Created ShareWithDoctorsIcon SVG for patient-specific visualization
- Updated provider descriptions to emphasize "95% of US providers" and "bi-directional EMR sync"
- Updated patient descriptions to emphasize "one place for all records" and "easy sharing"
- Added AnimatePresence transitions for smooth title changes when audience toggles

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-workflow.tsx (modified - added audience-specific title/icon logic)
- components/icons/workflow/share-with-doctors-icon.tsx (new)
- components/icons/workflow/index.ts (modified - added export)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- WorkflowStepData interface can have optional providerTitle/patientTitle to override default title per audience
- patientIcon field allows different icons for patient view without changing provider view
- AnimatePresence with unique key based on audience triggers re-animation on toggle
- SVG icons showing sharing/collaboration work well for patient-facing features (vs EMR/technical icons for providers)

## 2026-01-31 - US-014
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created ProviderFeatures component in app/(marketing)/features-provider.tsx
- 4 benefit cards with icons: Stop Chasing Records, Complete Context, Bi-directional Sync, HIPAA Certified
- Hover animation with subtle lift (y: -8) and shadow effect using Framer Motion
- Staggered entrance on scroll using useInView with staggerChildren: 0.15
- Emerald-500 accent color scheme matching brand
- Section header with GradientHeading
- Bottom accent line animation on hover

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/features-provider.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Component already existed as untracked file from previous work - verify git status for existing files before creating new ones
- Browser verification blocked by missing Supabase environment variables - not a code issue
- Feature cards use consistent pattern: icon in colored container, title, description, hover effects
- whileHover with spring stiffness: 400, damping: 17 creates snappy but natural lift animation
- Typecheck passed, browser verification pending environment setup

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-015
**Status:** PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created PatientFeatures component in app/(marketing)/features-patient.tsx
- 4 benefit cards with icons: All Your Records (FolderOpen), Understand Your Health (Brain), Share Easily (Share2), Always Free (Gift)
- Same animation patterns as ProviderFeatures: hover lift (y: -8), staggered scroll entrance (staggerChildren: 0.15)
- Same card styling: emerald-500 accents, shadow hover effects, bottom accent line
- Section header: "Your Health, Your Way" with patient-focused subheadline
- Uses GradientHeading and SectionCard components for consistency

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/features-patient.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Patient-focused copy emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and freedom: "No more hunting", "plain language", "No faxes", "No cost, no catch"
- Icons selected for clarity: FolderOpen (consolidation), Brain (understanding), Share2 (sharing), Gift (free value)
- Maintaining exact same animation parameters ensures visual consistency between audience-specific components
- Both ProviderFeatures and PatientFeatures ready for audience-aware rendering in US-016

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-016
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Rewrote marketing-features.tsx to use AudienceContext for audience-aware rendering
- Renders ProviderFeatures when audience is 'provider', PatientFeatures when 'patient'
- Added crossfade animation (300ms) using AnimatePresence with mode="wait"
- Removed old "Vibe Marketing" template content (600+ lines of social media dashboard UI)
- Added section id="features" for future anchor navigation
- Same animation pattern as marketing-hero.tsx (duration 0.3, easeInOut, y offset)

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-features.tsx (rewritten - 600 lines removed, 41 lines added)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Audience-aware sections follow consistent pattern: useAudience() + AnimatePresence mode="wait" + conditional rendering
- Use unique key prop on motion.div (e.g., key="provider-features") to trigger animation on content change
- Duration 0.3s (300ms) is the standard crossfade duration across all audience-aware sections
- Removing large template code reduces bundle size and improves maintainability
- Section id attributes (id="features") should be added for anchor navigation (upcoming US-027)

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-017
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created ProviderPricing component in app/(marketing)/pricing-provider.tsx
- Price display: '$1,500/month per 10 provider accounts' with large typography
- Feature list with icons: Unlimited record aggregation, Bi-directional EMR sync, Clinical Timeline View, HIPAA compliant & FHIR R4, Dedicated onboarding support, Up to 10 provider accounts
- CTA buttons: 'Request Access' (primary emerald) and 'Start 90-Day Pilot' (outline)
- Custom pricing note: "Need more than 10 providers? Contact us for custom pricing"
- Clean card-based design with emerald accent colors and subtle shadow hover effects
- Scroll-triggered staggered animations using Framer Motion's useInView

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/pricing-provider.tsx (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Pricing section follows same animation pattern as feature cards: useInView, staggered feature list
- Use section id="pricing" for anchor navigation (upcoming US-027)
- Feature list with icons uses map + staggered animation delay (0.3 + index * 0.05)
- Two CTA buttons pattern: primary action (Request Access) + secondary action (Start Pilot)
- Custom pricing note uses mailto: link for enterprise contacts

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-018
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Rewrote marketing-pricing.tsx to use AudienceContext for audience-aware visibility
- Renders ProviderPricing only when audience is 'provider'
- Completely hides pricing section when audience is 'patient' (not just empty content)
- Added smooth height transition using AnimatePresence with coordinated timing
- Height animation: 400ms with custom cubic-bezier easing [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]
- Opacity animation: 300ms fade, staggered with 100ms delay relative to height
- Uses overflow-hidden to prevent content from showing during height collapse

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-pricing.tsx (rewritten - 82 lines removed, 33 lines added)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- For hide/show sections (not just content swaps), use height: 0 ↔ height: "auto" animation
- AnimatePresence with height animation requires overflow-hidden to prevent layout bleed
- Stagger opacity and height: fade out first, collapse height second (exit); expand height first, fade in second (enter)
- Custom cubic-bezier [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] gives Material Design-style easing (deceleration curve)
- This pattern differs from crossfade pattern used in hero/features - those keep height consistent, this collapses entirely

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-019
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created marketing-social-proof.tsx component (replaces MarketingPartners in page.tsx)
- Header: "Trusted by Specialty Practices" with GradientHeading
- Placeholder practice logos grid (4 cards) using medical Lucide icons: Heart, Stethoscope, Building2, UserCheck
- Trust badges row with HIPAA Certified and FHIR R4 Compliant badges
- Testimonial quote section with doctor placeholder: Dr. Sarah Chen, Nashville Specialty Associates
- Subtle background gradient: emerald-50/30 → transparent → sky-50/20 with dark mode variants
- Staggered entrance animations using Framer Motion useInView with containerVariants/itemVariants pattern
- Hover effects on practice cards and trust badges (scale: 1.02, color transitions)

**Files changed:**
- app/(marketing)/marketing-social-proof.tsx (new)
- app/(marketing)/page.tsx (modified - replaced MarketingPartners import/usage with MarketingSocialProof)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Social proof sections work best with: logo grid → trust badges → testimonial quote (top-to-bottom trust building)
- Medical practice placeholder icons: Heart (cardiology), Stethoscope (primary care), Building2 (hospital), UserCheck (patient-focused)
- Trust badges should have distinct emerald accent styling to stand out as certifications
- Quote sections benefit from absolute-positioned quote icon badge for visual interest
- Avatar initials pattern: `name.split(" ").map((n) => n[0]).join("")` for quick avatar placeholder
- Background gradients should use pointer-events-none and z-10 on content to not block interactions

---

## 2026-01-31 - US-020
**Status:** ✅ PASSED
**What was implemented:**
- Created migration file for access_requests table in supabase/migrations/20260131132235_add_access_requests.sql
- Table columns: id (uuid pk), name (text), email (text), role ('provider'|'patient' check), practice_name (nullable), practice_size (nullable), created_at (timestamptz)
- Enabled RLS with policy allowing anonymous users to insert (public form submissions)
- Added TypeScript types to types/db.ts with Row, Insert, Update interfaces
- Note: Migration file is ready to push when Supabase project is linked (pnpx supabase db push)

**Files changed:**
- supabase/migrations/20260131132235_add_access_requests.sql (new)
- types/db.ts (modified - added access_requests table types)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Supabase CLI requires `supabase link` before `supabase db push` - check project link status first
- For public form submissions (like access requests), use anon role with insert-only RLS policy
- Types can be manually added to db.ts when auto-generation isn't available - follow existing table pattern (Row, Insert, Update interfaces)
- Role constraints use CHECK constraint: `role text not null check (role in ('provider', 'patient'))`
- Migration file naming: YYYYMMDDHHmmss_description.sql (e.g., 20260131132235_add_access_requests.sql)
