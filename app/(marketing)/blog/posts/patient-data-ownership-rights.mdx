Your medical records tell the story of your health journey. Every diagnosis, every lab result, every prescription—it all belongs to you. Yet for too long, accessing this information has felt like an uphill battle.

## Your Rights Under HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guarantees your right to access your health records. This is not a privilege granted by your healthcare providers—it is your legal right. You can request copies of your medical records, ask for corrections to inaccurate information, and choose who you share your data with.

Despite these protections, exercising your rights has never been simple. Your records are scattered across primary care offices, specialists, hospitals, labs, and pharmacies. Each system operates independently, often requiring separate requests, paperwork, and sometimes fees just to see your own information.

## The Problem with Fragmented Records

When you visit a new doctor, you might spend more time filling out forms from memory than actually discussing your health concerns. Important details get lost. Medication lists become outdated. Previous test results sit in another system, leading to duplicate tests and wasted time.

This fragmentation does not serve patients. It creates barriers to the continuity of care you deserve.
