Last Updated November 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy for LyfeVault, Inc. dba Lyfe AI (“**Lyfe**”) that describes the collection and use of Personal Data through Lyfe’s healthcare application and platform (“**Platform**”) and your interactions with Lyfe in any manner (collectively, the “**Services**”). This Privacy Policy is governed by and part of our Terms of Use. **By accessing our Services in any manner, you agree to our privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy.** If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not access or use our Services. If you have questions about our privacy practices, please contact Lyfe at [hello@lyfeco.ai](mailto:hello@lyfeco.ai).

1. **HEALTH PRIVACY**

Lyfe offers a web-based healthcare platform that integrates with multiple electronic medical record or electronic health record (“**EMR**”) systems to provide a unified interface for accessing and managing health data. The Platform allows (a) licensed healthcare providers subject to our Terms of Service (“**Providers**”) to access aggregated patient data from multiple EMR sources and AI-powered clinical decision support tools; (b) patients of Providers (“**Patients**”) to view and manage their own health information and care preferences on the Platform; and (c) legally authorized caregivers of Patients who are granted delegated access to manage a Patient’s account on the Platform (“**Caregivers**”). Patients grant their Caregiver(s) access to the Patient’s information on the Platform and identify the Caregiver’s permission, scope of access, and relationship to the Patient.

Lyfe collects and processes health data from the Patient’s Provider. For purposes the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“**HIPAA**”), Lyfe is a business associate to the Provider subject to a Business Associate Agreement. A Patient may withdraw their consent to their Provider to process their health data on the Services at any time by contacting their Provider. If you are a Patient and you have questions about health privacy, please contact your Provider.

2. **MINORS**

A parent or legal guardian may use the Services for a minor Patient who is their child as a Caregiver to that minor Patient. Caregivers of minor Patients establish access to the Platform on behalf of the minor Patient, subject to documentation and relationship verification. Caregivers of minor Patients are solely responsible for determining and providing authorization to other Users for Provider, Caregiver, or Patient access to data through the Platform. Lyfe will never knowingly collect Personal Data from a child online without prior express consent from the child’s parent or legal guardian. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Data from a child without authorization, we will delete that information.

3. **PERSONAL DATA**

As used in this Privacy Policy, “**Personal Data**” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Personal Data is typically described in categories, for example:

* **Identifiers** (e.g., name, email, telephone number, address); 

* **Sensitive information** (e.g., health information; government ID; racial or ethnic origin; religious beliefs; contents of messages when we are not the recipient; in some cases, information about a known child);

* **Legally protected information** (e.g., race, citizenship, marital status, sex);

* **Biometrics** (e.g., DNA, face/voice prints, health data) and audio, electronic, visual, thermal, or olfactory information;

* **Employment-related information** (e.g., current or past employment);

* **Non-public educational information**, including information protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. § 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99);

* **Commercial information** (e.g., products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies); 

* **Internet or other similar activity** (e.g., browsing history; content interactions); or 

* **Inferences** drawn from Personal Data to create a profile about preferences, characteristics, trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, and aptitudes.

Information that is sometimes **not protected** by law as Personal Data includes publicly available information; aggregated information (meaning data summaries or reports with Personal Data removed); or anonymized information that cannot be linked back to an individual.   

4. **LYFE’S PRIVACY PRACTICES**

Lyfe collects and uses Personal Data from Patients as described in this section. During the preceding 12 months, Lyfe has collected Patient identifiers, sensitive information (including health data), commercial information, and other categories of Personal Data that might be disclosed to us as a business associate to our Providers. We will not collect additional categories of Personal Data or use already collected Personal Data for purposes that are materially different, unrelated, or not reasonably necessary or compatible with the original purpose without notice and consent to you as required by law.

Lyfe collects your Personal Data (a) with your consent when you opt-in to use our Services; (b) if we have a legitimate interest in doing so, like providing the Services to our Providers; or (c) as authorized or required by law. We only collect, use, retain, and disclose Personal Data as is adequate and relevant to the specific, express purpose of providing the Services to our Providers or as reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve our internal business or other purposes permitted by applicable law. We collect and process Personal Data as described below:

* **Providers.** Providers and their Authorized Users register with Lyfe directly during the onboarding process. At registration, Lyfe collects the Authorized User’s name, login credentials, professional credentials, license number, practice details, and contact information. Lyfe will create an account and login credentials for each Authorized User under a Provider’s access to the Platform. 

  Providers use the Services to manage their Patients’ EMR. The Provider will disclose any health data or other Personal Data contained in their Patient’s EMR to Lyfe through secure integrations between the Platform and health information exchanges or other technology platforms. This may include, for example, identification information (name, contact information, gender, medical record number, etc.), clinical information (health profile, lab results, vital signs, etc.), care team details, behavioral health history, prescriptions, advanced directives, and other information in the Patient’s EMR. Lyfe applies HIPAA standards and requirements to all protected health information (“**PHI**”) on the Platform. Lyfe processes Personal Data relating to Authorized Users and any Personal Data input to the Platform by Authorized Users in our role as a service provider to the Provider. 

* **Patients.** Patients register with Lyfe to create their account and use the Platform. At registration, Lyfe collects the Patient’s full name, login credentials, date of birth, email address, phone number, and details necessary to verify the patient’s identity. The Patient also has the option to include in their profile additional contact details, emergency contact information, and their communication preferences. If a Patient authorizes a Caregiver associated with their account, Lyfe will collect documentation to confirm the Patient’s permissions, scope of access, and relationship to that Caregiver. All Personal Data about Patients that Lyfe collects from Patients or their Caregivers is processed with the Patient’s consent. 

* **Caregivers.** Patients may request access for a Caregiver to help manage the Patient’s health data on the Platform. When the Caregiver accepts access, the Caregiver creates an account on the Platform. At registration, Lyfe collects the Caregiver’s full name, login credentials, email address, phone number, and relationship to the Patient. Lyfe may require the Caregiver to submit legal documentation confirming the Caregiver’s legal authority to act on behalf of the Patient. Caregivers also have the option to submit additional contact information. All Personal Data about Caregivers is collected from the Caregiver and processed with the Caregiver’s consent.

* **Communications with Lyfe.** If you contact Lyfe for any reason, we will collect your full name, account ID or email address, and any other information you choose to include in your message to us. Providers, Patients, and Caregivers can interact with Lyfe through a chat feature on the Platform or by email to Lyfe’s customer service team. We use this information to provide customer support, technical assistance, account management, and to respond to privacy requests.  

* **Automatically collected through the Services.** Lyfe collects technical data to improve platform performance, user experience, and system reliability. The data collected for this purpose includes session information, page views, feature usage, system performance metrics, performance data, device information (type, operating system, browser), IP address, and generalized geographic location. This technical data is necessary for security and to analyze system performance and to improve the Services. 

  Similarly, if you visit our website or interact with our online channels, we may collect technical data, which may include Personal Data, like your IP address, browser type, browser version, and analytics data about your interactions with our content. We collect this data to achieve our legitimate interest of providing and improving our online presence and the Services we offer. 

We use the Personal Data we collect to provide and improve our Services as instructed by Providers, for internal business purposes, and as permitted or required by law. We may also use Personal Data to: maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our technology assets; protect the legal interests of Lyfe, our Provider or a Patient; respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations; for the purpose of a potential or current business transition involving the transfer of Personal Data as a company asset; or for any purpose with your consent. Any Personal Data protected under HIPAA is used only as permitted by the Provider subject to a business associate agreement with the Provider.

6. **DATA RETENTION**

Lyfe only retains Personal Data for the minimum period necessary to provide our Services or achieve our business goals. Our retention periods are governed by our contracts with Providers, HIPAA and other applicable laws, and Lyfe company policies. For example:

* Patient accounts are retained while the account remains active and the Patient is an active user of the Platform. Inactive Patient accounts are deleted after 3 years of inactivity.

* Caregiver account information is retained while the account is active. Personal Data is deleted 30 days after a Caregiver’s account is closed.

* EMR data is retained for 6 years from the date of creation or last Patient encounter. If the Patient was a minor at the time of treatment, their EMR data is retained until they reach age 18 or 6 years from the date of creation or last Patient encounter, whichever is longer.

* HIPAA-required audit logs are retained for 6 years from the date of creation or last Patient encounter.

* Access logs, security event logs, and audit trails are retained for 7 years.

Lyfe reserves the right to retain data for longer periods as required by law or court order or if doing so is critical to our business. We securely delete data at the conclusion of the applicable retention period.

7. **DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL DATA**

Lyfe will only disclose Personal Data to third parties as described in this section, with your permission, or as required by law. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed Personal Data for a business purpose to: 

* **Your Provider.** Providers associated with a Patient will have access to the Patient’s EMR data and other Personal Data on the Platform. Disclosure of EMR data and other PHI protected by HIPAA is subject to our business associate agreement with the Provider. Patients consent to this disclosure through the Provider’s notice of privacy practices and patient consent, as well as the Patient’s registration on the Platform. Lyfe does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of any Provider. Please direct any questions to your Provider.

* **Your Caregiver.** If a Patient authorizes a Caregiver to use the Platform in connection with the Patient’s account, the Caregiver will have access to the Personal Data within the scope of access and permissions selected by the Patient. Caregiver access to Patient Personal Data on the Platform is provided with the Patient’s consent. The Patient can modify Caregiver permissions at any time.

* **Lyfe’s service providers.** Lyfe’s service providers like cloud hosting, data security, analytics platforms, payment processing, and technical infrastructure may have access to Personal Data as needed to perform their contractual obligations to us. Lyfe executes HIPAA-compliant business associate agreements with each service provider that will have access to PHI as part of their services to us. We prohibit our service providers from selling or disclosing the Personal Data we provide, and we require all service providers to maintain confidentiality standards and appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of your Personal Data. 

* **Law enforcement**, and other governmental agencies, as permitted or required by law.

* **Other third parties**, as permitted by applicable law, for example: if we go through a business transition (e.g., merger, acquisition, or sale of a portion of our assets); to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; when we believe it is appropriate in order to take action regarding illegal activities or prevent fraud or harm to any person; to exercise or defend our legal claims; or for any other reason with your consent.

* **Aggregated and Deidentified Information.** Lyfe reserves the right to disclose aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data generated from data sets that may have included Personal Data, as well as reports generated based on these data sets, with nonaffiliated entities for research, marketing, or other purposes, without restriction. Lyfe may receive compensation in exchange for these disclosures, however, because no Personal Data is included in the data sets, doing so does not qualify as “selling” or “sharing” Personal Data under applicable privacy laws.

Some of these laws may not apply to our Services, in which case these notices are offered as a courtesy only.

* **Right to Nondiscrimination.** We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. For example, unless permitted by law we will not: (1) deny you goods or services; (2) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services; (3) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; (4) retaliate against you as an employee, applicant for employment, or independent contractor for exercising your privacy rights; or (5) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services, because you exercised a right under applicable privacy laws.
