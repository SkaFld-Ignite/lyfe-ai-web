Company Description  
Describe what your company does, who you serve, and how you’re different than competitors.

Lyfe AI is an AI-enabled platform that turns fragmented medical records into complete patient stories. We serve healthcare providers who need comprehensive patient histories before appointments, and patients who want to access, understand, and share their health data. Unlike competitors focused on either providers OR patients, Lyfe AI is the only platform serving both sides with bi-directional EMR sync—aggregating records from external sources and writing curated data back to the doctor's system of record.

How & why is this team positioned to succeed  
Explain what makes your founding team uniquely qualified to solve this problem or win in this market (1-2 sentences). List accomplishments, relevant industry experience, or specific past work that has prepared the team/founder to win (3-5 sentences).

Our team combines deep clinical expertise with proven technology and commercialization experience. Dr. Sumeet Bhanvadia (Co-Founder) is an oncologic surgeon and researcher who lived the problem firsthand—missing critical patient history at point of care. Charles Sims (CTO) has 10+ years scaling AI-powered platforms. Sagar Patel (CSO) brings 15 years of healthcare commercialization in venture-backed companies. Todd Orlando (CEO) provides banking, finance, and execution focus. Mike Belloli (Co-Founder) adds operational depth and execution capability. Fiona Akhtar (Customer Success Lead) ensures smooth onboarding and practice adoption. This combination of clinical credibility, technical depth, go-to-market experience, and customer success infrastructure positions us to build, sell, and scale in healthcare.

What does success look like for the team/company?  
Think about company impact, financial milestones, or specific outcomes you are aiming for?

Year 1: 25 practices, $400K ARR, proving product-market fit with independent and specialty practices. Year 3: 300 practices, $10M ARR, data licensing revenue unlocked. Year 5: 1,000 practices, $40M ARR, positioned as acquisition target for health systems, payers, or healthcare technology platforms seeking unified patient data assets.

1–2 Minute Founder Introduction Video  
All founders should appear in the video and introduce themselves & what they're building. Do not upload videos longer than 2 minutes. This is NOT a product demo.  
Will be provided

## **Business / Product**

Explain what your business or product does, who your target customers are, and how you generate revenue.  
Provide a clear, concise description of your solution, the problem it solves, your primary customer segments, and your revenue model (e.g., SaaS subscriptions, usage-based pricing, enterprise contracts, direct to consumer).

Lyfe AI aggregates patient health records from 95% of US healthcare providers through external health data networks, unifies them using AI into a searchable Clinical Timeline View, and syncs curated data bi-directionally to the doctor's EMR. Primary customers are independent and specialty practices who waste hours chasing scattered records. Revenue model: Per-practice SaaS subscription ($1500/month per 10 providers). Patients use the platform free—removing adoption barriers and enabling data collection for future analytics and licensing revenue.

Please provide a 2–3 minute product demo video.  
Link a founder-guided walkthrough showcasing your core features, key user flows, and what differentiates your product from alternatives.

How can reviewers access and test your product?  
Share any login credentials (username and password), access links, feature flags, or step-by-step instructions required to view or test your demo. If no login is required, please note that as well. Shared credentials will ONLY be shared internally with LaunchTN.  
Will be provided

Who are your primary competitors?  
List up to five direct or indirect competitors. You can include both well-known companies and emerging startups where relevant.

* Shared health data platforms (Zus Health, Health Gorilla, Particle Health)  
* Consumer health data APIs (Human API, Fasten Connect)  
* AI health assistants (ChatGPT Health, Claude Health)  
* Patient portals (Epic MyChart, Cerner Patient Portal)  
* Health information exchanges (CommonWell, Carequality)

What makes your product meaningfully different from competitors?  
Briefly describe your key advantages, such as proprietary technology, unique data, pricing, performance, distribution, or customer experience.

Shared health data platforms like Zus aggregate external records for providers but don't serve patients directly. Consumer health data APIs like Human API require patient authorization flows and don't include clinical workflow tools or EMR write-back. AI health assistants like ChatGPT Health and Claude Health help patients understand their records but lack provider-facing workflows and bi-directional EMR integration. Patient portals only show records from a single health system. Lyfe AI is the only platform that: (1) serves both providers AND patients on a unified platform, (2) offers bi-directional EMR sync—aggregating external data and writing curated insights back to the doctor's system of record, and (3) positions as an enhancement layer alongside existing EMRs rather than a replacement. HIPAA-certified, FHIR R4 compliant.

Describe your ideal customer profile (ICP).  
Include target industry, company size, buyer or user persona, core pain points, and typical adoption or buying pattern.

Independent and specialty medical practices (5-50 providers) with high patient complexity and referral volumes—oncology, cardiology, multi-specialty groups. Buyer: Practice administrator or physician owner frustrated by time wasted chasing records from other providers. Pain points: Missing critical clinical context (ER visits, medication changes), incomplete patient histories at point of care, inefficient chart prep. Buying pattern: Typically adopts after experiencing a near-miss or adverse event due to missing information; 90-day pilot removes risk.

How many active users and/or paying customers do you currently have?  
Provide the total number of active users and/or paying customers. If both, you may include a breakdown.

First paying practice launching January 2026\. Second practice ready for integration. Active pipeline of specialty practices expressing interest.

How have you validated market demand and customer need for your solution?  
Describe how you conducted customer discovery and validated demand. Where applicable, include: number of customer interviews and key insights, validated pain points, number of LOIs signed and customer types, pilots or trials (status, participants, expected conversions), waitlist or sales pipeline volume, and any strategic or go-to-market partnerships.

Platform built and demo-ready. First paying customer committed for January 2026 launch. Second practice signed. Strong pipeline interest from specialty practices validates demand. Customer discovery revealed consistent pain point: doctors waste hours daily chasing scattered records, and critical clinical context (ER visits, medication changes) is routinely missing at point of care.
